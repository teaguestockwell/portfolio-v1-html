              <p>
                When I entered the workforce in 2017 I was passionate, young, and all too na√Øve. Throughout high school, I was ecstatic about woodworking as an avenue for creativity and building from scratch. I scoured my community from door to door during the blaze of the Las Vegas summer looking for an opportunity to build shelving units for my neighbors. It was with this passion that I found my first job as a cabinet maker. I quickly realized, the rest of my coworkers at the cabinet shop, did not share that same drive and passion. Many of whom, were still searching for their purpose. I had to act to find that purpose, so I joined the Air Force as an aircraft mechanic. I found that purpose as a crew chief on the C-17. 
                As a now young man, I enjoyed such a unique experience growing in the Air Force as an aircraft mechanic. No other job offers the same opportunity for growth that the military does. I was hungry for more, so I started attending school full time studying computer programming.
                Towards the end of my program, I realized that although I had a purpose as an aircraft mechanic, I was unfulfilled. Something was missing. That same passion and creativity that I once had as a cabinet maker had no outlet. I pulled from my education to find this outlet for creativity by solving a problem at work. What followed was how I realized my passion for programming and incorporated it to solve a problem in the Air force. After investing over 500 hours of my own time, I developed a weight and balance application for the C-17. What used to take 20+ minutes can be done in 1 minute.
                Now, as a full-time software developer assigned to a team within the Air Force, I am developing the second version of that application for the entire fleet of cargo planes. Using my education, I found an outlet for creativity that allows me to grow professionally and be more impactful for the Air force.

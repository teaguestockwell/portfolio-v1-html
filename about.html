            <p2>Hello, and welcome to my very first website. It's not even the end of week two, and I can tell that im going to realy enjoy
                the content in this class. Some more info about me... I am a Senior Airman in the Airforce with 3 year of service. In my free time
                I enjoy hiking and programming. Of which, my current passion project is a Flutter app for IPhone and Android which I have posted in my Github repo.
                <br>
                <br>
                The Flutter app is built based on one of my previous native android apps that is for aircraft weight and balance. Im learning so much about
                programing by writing mobile apps. The next big task for the flutter app is to pull the firebase documents that contain fields of nested key value pair
                into the app as classes. This would be easier, but im linking to nested collections that might not have the same amount of documents, and I would like to minimize
                my document reads so I can remain in the free tier. The Android app has 100 active installs 
                as of 2020-09-29, and im in the procces of getting it officialy vetted at my work. 
                <br>
                <br>
                <p2>I look forward to working with all of you.</p2>
